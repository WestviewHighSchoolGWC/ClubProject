<h3>
<p class="text-center">Develop a study routine.</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">If you study better in the morning, start early before taking a break at lunchtime. If you're more productive during the night, take a larger break earlier on so you’re ready to study in the evening.</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-center">Set aside time for studying.</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">DON’T leave it until the last minute and cram. Write down what exams you have on a calendar, taking into account the difficulty of each, along with the amount of time you have. Also, write down everything you need to do and assign each task an estimated amount of time.</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-center">Organize your study space.</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">Make sure you feel focused and comfortable. Take into account what works for you, whether that may be a quiet or noisy space. Whatever you feel the need to do is okay, as long as it works for you.
</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-center">Practice and review old assignments and exams.</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">Using this method will give you an idea for what will be on your test, since it is likely that your teacher will ask similar questions about the same concepts. Look over what you had trouble with in the past, as well as what you feel you have forgotten.
</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-center">Teach others.</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">This will help you structure things in your head quickly and reveal the areas in which you need to work on more.
</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-center">Organize study groups with friends.</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">Your friends will probably be able to answer your questions and be willing to help you practice for your test!
</p>

<h2>
<p class="text-center">Study Breaks</p>

<h4>
<p class="text-center">Don’t feel guilty!

<h4>
<p class="text-center">“Vitamin D is important for a healthy brain.”
</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-center">Eat nutritious snacks and drink water.
</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">Eating healthily will help increase your energy levels and focus, and is even proven to aid concentration and memory; drinking lots of water and being well hydrated is essential for your brain to be at its highest potential. Also, don't forget to eat a good meal before your test!

</h4>

<h4>
<p class="text-left">Preheat oven to 225℉. Then, slice apples as thin as possible. After that, sprinkle some cinnamon/cinnamon sugar on the apples (optional). Finally, place them on a tray and put the apples in the oven for 1-2 hrs. This works best on a baking rack and you may need to cook them for longer, depending on the thickness of the chips. </p>
</h4><br/>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">Sweet Crispy Roasted Chickpeas
 </p>
</h4>

<h4>
<p class="text-left">Preheat oven to 375℉. Then, rinse and drain chickpeas. After that, place chickpeas on a baking tray and bake for about 45 min to an 1 hr. Next, in a bowl, mix olive oil, honey, and cinnamon sugar (you can eyeball the measurements and change it to your personal preference). Then, once the chickpeas are dry, put them into the bowl that holds the sweet sauce and mix it all in. Finally, once you are done coating the chickpeas, place them back in the oven for 10 mins.
 </p>

<h2>
<p class="text-center">class-wise</p>
</h2>
<h3>
<p class="text-left">Pay attention in class</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">It is important to concentrate and be attentive when the teacher is talking. This is especially important when they’re giving lectures about a lesson because you will need the information for your homework and future tests.<br/>
Also, it’s disrespectful to not pay attention to your teacher. Ignore your friends if they are being loud because then you will probably end up being the one with the best grades in your friend group. Being a prominent distraction, you should also turn off your cell phone unless you have an emergency.
 </p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-left">Ask questions if you do not understand</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">No one is going to answer your question if you do not ask it. Don't be quiet and let your chances of asking that question slip away. This is because then you might never find out the answer and a question similar to it may be on the test or quiz. </p>
</h4>
<h2>
<p class="text-center">organizationally</p>
</h2>
<h3>
<p class="text-left">Have a homework planner </p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">This helps you know when each test is, and when assignments/projects are due. It also helps you prioritize what you need to do first. At the end of every day make sure that you will be able to be turned in on time.
</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-left">Make sure your backpack has all the stuff you need for the next day.
 </p>
</h3>
<h3>
<p class="text-left">Keep past assignments, homework, tests etc. whatever you get in class so you can study them when the test comes.
 </p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">It is a good idea to keep these items in chronological order.
</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-left">Make sure your notes are complete and organized
 </p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">If you do not include information in your notes, it might come up again on an assignment or test and then you might not know anything about it. Your notes do not have to look like the aesthetic notebooks you see on Pinterest and stuff, but you have to be able to read your notes when the test comes around so you can review them.
</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p class="text-left">Review notes after school
 </p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p class="text-left">This really helps in the long run so you are not cramming everything you learned in the unit or semester when the test comes. Furthermore, as much as 80% of the material you learn in class is forgotten within 24 hours if you do not review it.</p>
